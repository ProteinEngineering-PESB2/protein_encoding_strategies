# Numeric representation of protein sequences

Numeric representations of protein sequences is a requirement to apply machine learning algorithms.

There are different strategies and methodologies available to solve this problem. However, there are no a consensus 
concerning the specific strategy to employee. In this repository, we implement and leave enabled different methods to encoding 
sequences, considering classical strategies and more recent advances using protein language techniques.

## Available strategies

### One hot encoding

One hot is a binarization strategies that encoding each residue as a binary vector of 0 and 1 which size depends on
the vocabulary size. We have to modalities: Normal execution and parallel execution. 

### Physicochemical properties

### Signal transformation

### Spatial transformation
